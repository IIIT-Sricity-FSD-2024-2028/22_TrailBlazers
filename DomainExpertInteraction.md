## Domain Context and Terminology

- The purpose of this problem statement is to ensure that events are not only executed smoothly but also evaluated meaningfully. In practice, many event activities such as attendance tracking, session participation, engagement, and issue handling are managed in a fragmented or informal way, making it difficult to clearly understand what actually happened during the event. This problem focuses on bringing structure and visibility to event execution and linking it with post-event analysis, so that event success can be evaluated based on real execution data rather than assumptions, and insights can be used to improve future events.

- **Primary Goals and Outcomes of our problem statement:**
  - Ensure smooth, well-coordinated event execution with clear task ownership.
  - Centralize and accurately record attendance (RSVP vs actual) for every session.
  - Monitor session-level engagement in real time (polls, Q&A, participation signals).
  - Log and manage on-site incidents and operational issues systematically.
  - Produce reliable and standardized post-event analytics.
  - Enable clear reporting of outcomes to stakeholders or clients.
  - Identify trends across multiple events to improve future planning.
  - Reduce manual effort and errors caused by fragmented tracking methods.
