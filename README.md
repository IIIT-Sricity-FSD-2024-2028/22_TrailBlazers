**Problem statement:**  
**Event Execution and Post - Event Analytics Platform**  
---

## Overview :
In real-world events, clients depend on event managers and on-site coordinators to execute events smoothly, but visibility into attendee participation, session engagement, and operational issues is often fragmented or informal.

Engagement data such as RSVPs, actual attendance, session participation, and time spent at the event is usually tracked manually or not consolidated in one place.

On-site activities like check-ins, issue handling, and attendee movement are managed separately, making it difficult to relate execution quality to event outcomes.

After the event, event managers must manually interpret participation trends and feedback to report event success to clients.

There is a need for a structured way to support event execution and post-event evaluation based on how events are actually managed in practice.
